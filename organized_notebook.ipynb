No delay or omission on the part of any party in exercising any right, power or remedy under this Agreement will operate as a waiver thereof.\\nProvisions Concerning the Sellers’ Representative.\\nAppointment.  Each Seller hereby irrevocably appoints [●] as the sole and exclusive agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact for such Seller for all purposes of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions, with full and exclusive power and authority to act on such Seller’s behalf (the “Sellers’ Representative”).  The appointment of the Sellers’ Representative hereunder is coupled with an interest, shall be irrevocable and shall not be affected by the death, incapacity, insolvency, bankruptcy, illness or other inability to act of any Seller.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Sellers’ Representative is hereby authorized, on behalf of the Sellers, to:\\nin connection with the Closing, execute and receive all documents, instruments, certificates, statements and agreements on behalf of and in the name of each Seller necessary to effectuate the Closing and consummate the Contemplated Transactions;\\nreceive and give all notices and service of process, make all filings, enter into all Contractual Obligations, make all decisions, bring, prosecute, defend, settle, compromise or otherwise resolve all claims, disputes and Actions, authorize payments in respect of any such claims, disputes or Actions, and take all other actions, in each case, with respect to the matters set forth in Section 2.06, Article VII, Article VIII or any other Actions directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions;\\nreceive and give all notices, make all decisions and take all other actions on behalf of the Sellers in connection with the escrow account established pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, including giving any instructions or authorizations to the Escrow Agent to pay from such escrow account any amounts owed by the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement or otherwise in connection with the Contemplated Transactions;\\nexecute and deliver, should it elect to do so in its good faith discretion, on behalf of the Sellers, any amendment to, or waiver of, any term or provision of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, or any consent, acknowledgment or release relating to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; and\\ntake all other actions permitted or required to be taken by or on behalf of the Sellers under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement and exercise any and all rights that the Sellers or the Sellers’ Representative are permitted or required to do or exercise under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.\\nLiability.  The Sellers’ Representative shall not be held liable by any of the Sellers for actions or omissions in exercising or failing to exercise all or any of the power and authority of the Sellers’ Representative pursuant to this Agreement, except in the case of the Sellers’ Representative’s gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.  The Sellers’ Representative shall be entitled to rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other independent experts that it reasonably determines to be experienced in the matter at issue, and will not be liable to any Seller for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith based on such advice.  Each Seller will severally (and not jointly) indemnify (in accordance with its Pro Rata Percentage) the Sellers’ Representative from any Losses arising out of its serving as the Sellers’ Representative hereunder, except for Losses arising out of or caused by the Sellers’ Representative’s gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.  The Sellers’ Representative is serving in its capacity as such solely for purposes of administrative convenience, and is not personally liable in such capacity for any of the obligations of the Sellers hereunder, and the Buyer agrees that it will not look to the personal assets of the Sellers’ Representative, acting in such capacity, for the satisfaction of any obligations to be performed by the Sellers hereunder.\\nReliance on Appointment; Successor Sellers’ Representative.  The Buyer may rely on the appointment and authority of the Sellers’ Representative granted pursuant to this Section 11.04 until receipt of written notice of the appointment of a successor Sellers’ Representative made in accordance with this Section 11.04.  In so doing, the Buyer may rely on any and all actions taken by and decisions of the Sellers’ Representative under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement among any of the Sellers or the Sellers’ Representative with respect to any such action or decision without any Liability to, or obligation to inquire of, any Seller, the Sellers’ Representative or any other Person.  Any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers’ Representative shall constitute a decision of all the Sellers and shall be final and binding upon each of the Sellers.  At any time after the Closing, with or without cause, by a written instrument that is signed in writing by holders of at least a majority-in-interest of the Sellers (determined by reference to their respective Pro Rata Percentages) and delivered to Parent, the Sellers may remove and designate a successor Sellers’ Representative; provided, that such successor Sellers’ Representative must be reasonably acceptable to Parent.  If the Sellers’ Representative shall at any time resign or otherwise cease to function in its capacity as such for any reason whatsoever, and no successor that is reasonably acceptable to Parent is appointed by such holders of a majority-in-interest of the Sellers within ten (10) Business Days, then Parent shall have the right to appoint another Seller to act as the replacement Sellers’ Representative who shall serve as described in this Agreement and, under such circumstances, the Buyer shall be entitled to rely on any and all actions taken and decisions made by such replacement Sellers’ Representative.\\nEntire Agreement.  This Agreement, together with the other Ancillary Agreements and any documents, instruments and certificates explicitly referred to herein, constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all prior discussions, negotiations, proposals, undertakings, understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, with respect thereto.  There are no restrictions, promises, warranties, covenants, or undertakings, other than those expressly provided for herein and therein.\\nCounterparts; Facsimile Signature.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute but one and the same instrument.  This Agreement will become effective when duly executed and delivered by each party hereto.  Counterpart signature pages to this Agreement may be delivered by facsimile or electronic delivery (i.e., by email of a PDF signature page) and each such counterpart signature page will constitute an original for all purposes.\\nSeverability.  Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction.  In the event that any provision hereof would, under applicable Legal Requirements, be invalid or unenforceable in any respect, each party hereto intends that such provision will be construed by modifying or limiting it so as to be valid and enforceable to the maximum extent compatible with, and possible under, applicable Legal Requirements.\\nGoverning Law.  This Agreement, the rights of the parties hereunder and all Actions arising in whole or in part under or in connection herewith (including any Action based upon, arising out of, or related to any representation or warranty made in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the domestic substantive laws of the State of Delaware, including its statute of limitations, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.\\nJurisdiction; Venue; Service of Process.\\nJurisdiction.

Each of the parties to this Agreement agrees that for any Action among any of the parties relating to or arising in whole or in part under or in connection with this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions, such party shall bring such Action only in the State of Delaware.

Each party hereto further waives any claim and will not assert that venue should properly lie in any other location within the selected jurisdiction\\nService of Process.  Each party hereby (i) consents to service of process in any Action between the parties arising in whole or in part under or in connection with this Agreement in any manner permitted by Delaware law, (ii) agrees that service of process made in accordance with clause (i) or made by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at its address specified pursuant to Section 8.01, will constitute good and valid service of process in any such Action and (iii) waives and agrees not to assert (by way of motion, as a defense, or otherwise) in any such Action any claim that service of process made in accordance with clause (i) or (ii) does not constitute good and valid service of process.\\nSpecific Performance.  Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the other parties would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are breached or violated.  Accordingly, each of the parties agrees that, without posting a bond or other undertaking, the other parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or violations of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any Action instituted in any court of Israel or of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the parties and the matter in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled, at law or in equity.  Each party further agrees that, in the event of any action for specific performance in respect of such breach or violation, it will not assert that the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.\\nWaiver of Jury Trial.  TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE, AND COVENANT THAT THEY WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE), ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE.  THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED-FOR AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION WHATSOEVER BETWEEN OR AMONG THEM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS AND THAT SUCH ACTIONS WILL INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.\\nNo Recourse. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or otherwise, the parties hereto agree on their own behalf and on behalf of their respective Affiliates that this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any action, suit or claim for breach of this Agreement may only be made against, the parties hereto, and no non-party will have any liability relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated herein or therein.\\nSchedules.
