Each Seller hereby irrevocably appoints [●] as the sole and exclusive agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact for such Seller for all purposes of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions, with full and exclusive power and authority to act on such Seller’s behalf (the “Sellers’ Representative”).  The appointment of the Sellers’ Representative hereunder is coupled with an interest, shall be irrevocable and shall not be affected by the death, incapacity, insolvency, bankruptcy, illness or other inability to act of any Seller.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Sellers’ Representative is hereby authorized, on behalf of the Sellers, to:\\nin connection with the Closing, execute and receive all documents, instruments, certificates, statements and agreements on behalf of and in the name of each Seller necessary to effectuate the Closing and consummate the Contemplated Transactions;\\nreceive and give all notices and service of process, make all filings, enter into all Contractual Obligations, make all decisions, bring, prosecute, defend, settle, compromise or otherwise resolve all claims, disputes and Actions, authorize payments in respect of any such claims, disputes or Actions, and take all other actions, in each case, with respect to the matters set forth in Section 2.06, Article VII, Article VIII or any other Actions directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions;\\nreceive and give all notices, make all decisions and take all other actions on behalf of the Sellers in connection with the escrow account established pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, including giving any instructions or authorizations to the Escrow Agent to pay from such escrow account any amounts owed by the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement or otherwise in connection with the Contemplated Transactions;\\nexecute and deliver, should it elect to do so in its good faith discretion, on behalf of the Sellers, any amendment to, or waiver of, any term or provision of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, or any consent, acknowledgment or release relating to this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; and\\ntake all other actions permitted or required to be taken by or on behalf of the Sellers under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement and exercise any and all rights that the Sellers or the Sellers’ Representative are permitted or required to do or exercise under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.\\nLiability.  The Sellers’ Representative shall not be held liable by any of the Sellers for actions or omissions in exercising or failing to exercise all or any of the power and authority of the Sellers’ Representative pursuant to this Agreement, except in the case of the Sellers’ Representative’s gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.  The Sellers’ Representative shall be entitled to rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other independent experts that it reasonably determines to be experienced in the matter at issue, and will not be liable to any Seller for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith based on such advice.  Each Seller will severally (and not jointly) indemnify (in accordance with its Pro Rata Percentage) the Sellers’ Representative from any Losses arising out of its serving as the Sellers’ Representative hereunder, except for Losses arising out of or caused by the Sellers’ Representative’s gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.  The Sellers’ Representative is serving in its capacity as such solely for purposes of administrative convenience, and is not personally liable in such capacity for any of the obligations of the Sellers hereunder, and the Buyer agrees that it will not look to the personal assets of the Sellers’ Representative, acting in such capacity, for the satisfaction of any obligations to be performed by the Sellers hereunder.\\nReliance on Appointment; Successor Sellers’ Representative.  The Buyer may rely on the appointment and authority of the Sellers’ Representative granted pursuant to this Section 11.04 until receipt of written notice of the appointment of a successor Sellers’ Representative made in accordance with this Section 11.04.  In so doing, the Buyer may rely on any and all actions taken by and decisions of the Sellers’ Representative under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement among any of the Sellers or the Sellers’ Representative with respect to any such action or decision without any Liability to, or obligation to inquire of, any Seller, the Sellers’ Representative or any other Person.  Any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers’ Representative shall constitute a decision of all the Sellers and shall be final and binding upon each of the Sellers.  At any time after the Closing, with or without cause, by a written instrument that is signed in writing by holders of at least a majority-in-interest of the Sellers (determined by reference to their respective Pro Rata Percentages) and delivered to Parent, the Sellers may remove and designate a successor Sellers’ Representative; provided, that such successor Sellers’ Representative must be reasonably acceptable to Parent.  If the Sellers’ Representative shall at any time resign or otherwise cease to function in its capacity as such for any reason whatsoever, and no successor that is reasonably acceptable to Parent is appointed by such holders of a majority-in-interest of the Sellers within ten (10) Business Days, then Parent shall have the right to appoint another Seller to act as the replacement Sellers’ Representative who shall serve as described in this Agreement and, under such circumstances, the Buyer shall be entitled to rely on any and all actions taken and decisions made by such replacement Sellers’ Representative.\\nEntire Agreement.  This Agreement, together with the other Ancillary Agreements and any documents, instruments and certificates explicitly referred to herein, constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all prior discussions, negotiations, proposals, undertakings, understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, with respect thereto.  There are no restrictions, promises, warranties, covenants, or undertakings, other than those expressly provided for herein and therein.\\nCounterparts; Facsimile Signature.

This Agreement will become effective when duly executed and delivered by each party hereto.  Counterpart signature pages to this Agreement may be delivered by facsimile or electronic delivery (i.e., by email of a PDF signature page) and each such counterpart signature page will constitute an original for all purposes.\\nSeverability.  Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction.  In the event that any provision hereof would, under applicable Legal Requirements, be invalid or unenforceable in any respect, each party hereto intends that such provision will be construed by modifying or limiting it so as to be valid and enforceable to the maximum extent compatible with, and possible under, applicable Legal Requirements.\\nGoverning Law.

Each party hereto further waives any claim and will not assert that venue should properly lie in any other location within the selected jurisdiction\\nService of Process.  Each party hereby (i) consents to service of process in any Action between the parties arising in whole or in part under or in connection with this Agreement in any manner permitted by Delaware law, (ii) agrees that service of process made in accordance with clause (i) or made by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at its address specified pursuant to Section 8.01, will constitute good and valid service of process in any such Action and (iii) waives and agrees not to assert (by way of motion, as a defense, or otherwise) in any such Action any claim that service of process made in accordance with clause (i) or (ii) does not constitute good and valid service of process.\\nSpecific Performance.  Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the other parties would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are breached or violated.  Accordingly, each of the parties agrees that, without posting a bond or other undertaking, the other parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or violations of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any Action instituted in any court of Israel or of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the parties and the matter in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled, at law or in equity.  Each party further agrees that, in the event of any action for specific performance in respect of such breach or violation, it will not assert that the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.\\nWaiver of Jury Trial.  TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE, AND COVENANT THAT THEY WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE), ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE.

The Sellers’ Representative shall be entitled to rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other independent experts that it reasonably determines to be experienced in the matter at issue, and will not be liable to any Seller for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith based on such advice. Each Seller will severally (and not jointly) indemnify (in accordance with its Pro Rata Percentage) the Sellers’ Representative from any Losses arising out of its serving as the Sellers’ Representative hereunder, except for Losses arising out of or caused by the Sellers’ Representative’s gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.

The decision of the Accounting Firm with respect to the disputed items of the Proposed Final Closing Statement submitted to it will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. As used herein, the Proposed Final Closing Statement as adjusted to reflect any changes agreed to by the parties and the decision of the Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 2.07 is referred to herein as the “Final Closing Statement”.

The Escrow Amount shall be held and, subject to Section 2.07, released to the Company Securityholders in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow Agreement with the Company Securityholders being entitled to share in such released amounts in accordance with their Pro Rata Percentages. From and after the Closing, Buyer and the Sellers’ Representative will direct the Escrow Agent to disburse payments from the Escrow Account in accordance with the purchase price adjustment provisions of this Agreement and the terms of the Escrow Agreement including: (a) in the case of any disbursement that is required by the terms of this Agreement and as to which there is no dispute (or as to which the disputing party has failed to notify the Escrow Agent and the other parties of its dispute in accordance with any applicable requirements under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement), they will provide prompt joint payment instructions directing the Escrow Agent to make such disbursement and (b) in the case of a disbursement as to which either the Buyer or the Seller’s Representative has notified the other and the Escrow Agent (in accordance with any notice and timing requirements applicable under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement) that there is a good faith dispute, they will provide joint payment instructions to the Escrow Agent to direct the appropriate disbursement promptly upon the resolution, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, of such dispute. Recovery from the Escrow Amount shall constitute the Buyer’s exclusive remedy against the Company Securityholders in connection with any claim relating to any adjustments of the Purchase Price (as set forth in Section 2.07(e)) and any such claim shall expire upon the termination of the Escrow Agreement. Withholding Rights. (a)\tNotwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each of the Buyer or anyone acting on its behalf, the Paying Agent, the Escrow Agent and the Section 102 Trustee and any other applicable withholding agent (each a “Payor”), shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Closing Cash Payment and from any other payments otherwise required pursuant to this Agreement, such amount in cash as the Buyer and/or such anyone acting on its behalf is required to deduct and withhold with respect to any payments under the Code or any provision of state, local, provincial or foreign law, unless the applicable Payee (as defined below) provides the Payor, at least five days prior to the proposed date of such payment, with a valid withholding certificate obtained from the applicable tax authorities, exempting the payment to such payee from withholding tax or reducing the amount thereof. To the extent that the amounts are so deducted or withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid or issued, as applicable, to such Payee in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made and, upon request, the Payor shall promptly provide the applicable Payee with a document evidencing the amount so withheld and remitted to the Tax authority with respect to the payment made to such Payee. Notwithstanding the above provisions, with respect to Israeli Taxes, and in accordance with the Paying Agent undertaking provided to Buyer as required under Section 6.2.4.3 of the Income Tax Circular 19/2018 (Transaction for Sale of Rights in a Corporation that Includes Consideration that will be Transferred to the Company Stockholders at Future Dates) (the “Paying Agent Undertaking”), any consideration payable or otherwise to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement on the Closing to any Company Securityholder (other than holders of 102 Securities) or any other Person entitled to payments hereunder (each a “Payee”) will be retained by the Paying Agent, for the benefit of such Payee for a period of up to 180 days from the Closing Date or as otherwise requested by the ITA (the “Withholding Drop Date”), during which time such Payee may obtain a valid certificate or ruling issued by the ITA in form and substance reasonable acceptable to Buyer and the Paying Agent, which: (i) exempts Buyer and the Paying Agent from the duty to withhold Israeli Taxes with respect to such payment to Payee, (ii) determines the applicable rate or amounts of Israeli Taxes to be withheld from the payment due to such Payee, or (iii) provides any other instructions regarding the payment or withholding with respect to the applicable portion of the consideration due to such Payee as determined by the ITA (the “Valid Certificate”). The Paying Agent will act in accordance with the provisions of any Valid Certificate to Buyer and/or the Paying Agent, provided such Valid Certificate is provided not later than three Business Days prior to the Withholding Drop Date. If a Payee (i) does not provide Buyer or the Paying Agent with a Valid Certificate at least three Business Days prior to the Withholding Drop Date or (ii) submits a written request to the Paying Agent to release such Payee’s payment prior to ‎the Withholding Drop Date without submitting a Valid Withholding Certificate, then the amount to be withheld and transferred to the ITA from the amounts payable to such Payee will be calculated according to the applicable withholding rate as reasonably determined by Buyer and the Paying Agent. Such amount will be delivered or caused to be delivered to the ITA by the Paying Agent, and the Paying Agent will release to such Payee the balance of the amount due to such Payee that is not so withheld. In the event that a Payor receives a written demand from the ITA to withhold any amount out of the amount held by such Payor for distribution to a particular Payee and transfer it to the ITA prior to the Withholding Drop Date, such Payor (i) will notify such Payee of such matter reasonably promptly after receipt of such demand, and provide such Payee with reasonable time (but in no event less than 7 days, unless otherwise required by the ITA) to attempt to delay such requirement or extend the period for complying with such requirement as evidenced by a written certificate, ruling or confirmation from the ITA, and (ii) to the extent that any such certificate, ruling or confirmation is not provided by such Payee to the Payor prior to the time required by the ITA, will transfer to the ITA any amount so demanded, including any interest, indexation and fines required by the ITA in respect thereof, and such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been delivered and paid to such Payee. Any withholding made in Israel New Shekel (“NIS”) with respect to payments made hereunder in USD will be calculated based on the Exchange Rate on the most recent Business Day preceding the payment date, and the applicable Payee shall bear sole and exclusive Liability for any foreign currency conversion fee or commission or other fee, cost, Tax, duty or charge applicable to the conversion of such amount from USD to NIS, which such amount shall be deducted from payments to be made to such Payee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, with respect to holders of Options who are individuals and are not Israeli residents for Israeli Tax purposes, who were granted such awards in consideration solely for work or services performed entirely outside of Israel (and who will provide Buyer and Paying Agent, prior to any payment to them, no later than three Business Days before such payment is due, with a validly executed declaration in the form attached hereto as Exhibit [●] regarding their non-Israeli residence and confirmation that they were granted such awards in consideration solely for work or services performed entirely outside of Israel), such payments will not be subject to any withholding or deduction of Israeli Tax and, to the extent such individual are employed by the Company at the time of payment, will be made through the Company’s payroll payment system. If such declaration is not provided at least three Business Days prior to the day of the applicable payment, then such payment will be subject to tax withholding as will be reasonably determined by Buyer or the Paying Agent. Payments of Employee Closing Bonus. Prior to the date hereof, the Company has approved cash bonuses, the aggregate amount of which shall be equal to the Employee Closing Bonus Amount, to the individuals listed in Exhibit 2.10 (the “Employees Closing Bonus Beneficiaries”). At the Closing the Buyer shall deposit the Employee Closing Bonus Amount with the [Company] and shall cause the Company to pay through its payroll system to each Employees Closing Bonus Beneficiary its respective share the Employee Closing Bonus Amount in accordance with the allocation set for tin Exhibit 2.10.

Capitalization of the Acquired Companies. Authorized and Outstanding Equity Interests. The entire authorized capital stock (or, where applicable, other Equity Interests) of each Acquired Company is as set forth on Schedule 3.05.

The Company has delivered to the Buyer accurate and complete copies of the stock ledger (or equivalent records) of each Acquired Company, which records reflect all issuances, transfers, repurchases and cancellations of shares of capital stock (or other Equity Interests) of each Acquired Company. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock (or, where applicable, other Equity Interests) of each Acquired Company have been duly authorized, validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable. None of the Acquired Companies has violated any Legal Requirements applicable to it, including any federal or state securities laws, or any preemptive or other similar rights of any Person in connection with the issuance, repurchase or redemption of any of its Equity Interests or other securities, except where such violation has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has taken all actions necessary to ensure that (i) all outstanding Options have been cancelled effective as of the Closing and (ii) the Company Stock Plans terminated at Closing, the provisions in any other plan or agreement providing for the issuance, transfer or grant of any Equity Interests of any Acquired Company terminated at Closing, and no holder of an Option or any participant in any Company Stock Plan or other plan or any party to a Contractual Obligation with any Acquired Company has any right thereunder to acquire any Equity Interests of any Acquired Company. Outstanding Options. As of the date of this Agreement, the Company has reserved [●] shares of Company Common Stock for issuance pursuant to the Company Stock Plans, of which [●] shares are subject to outstanding and unexercised Options and [●] shares remain available for issuance thereunder. Schedule 3.05(b) sets forth, as of the date of this Agreement, a true, correct and complete list of all Optionholders, and each Option, whether or not granted under the Company Stock Plan, including the holder’s country of residence, the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each Option, the number of such shares that are vested or unvested, the “date of grant” of such Option (as defined under Treasury Regulation 1.409A-1(b)(5)(vi)(B) in the case of US Options), the vesting commencement date, the vesting schedule (and the terms of any acceleration thereof), the exercise price per share, in the case of Options granted to Israeli grantees, whether each such Option was granted and is subject to tax pursuant to Section 3(i) of the Income Tax Ordinance or Section 102 of the Income Tax Ordinance and specifying the subsection of Section 102 of the Income Tax Ordinance pursuant to which the Option was granted and is subject to tax and whether an election was made to treat such Option under the capital gain route or ordinary income route, and in the case of Options granted to US grantees, the tax status of such Option under Section 422 of the Code,  the term of each Option, the Option Plan under which such Option was granted (if any) and the country and state of residence provided by such Optionholder. All Options listed on Schedule 3.05(b) that are denoted as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code so qualify and will continue to so qualify as of immediately prior to the consummation of the Transactions. The Company Stock Plans have been established and maintained in all material respects in compliance with all applicable laws. No Equity Interests are outstanding under the Company Stock Plans other than Options (and shares acquired through the exercise of Options). Each Option intended to qualify as an “incentive stock option” has fully satisfied in all material respects all requirements under Section 422 of the Code. In addition, Schedule 3.05(b) indicates, as of the Agreement Date, which Optionholders are Persons that are not employees of the Acquired Companies (including non-employee directors, consultants, advisory board members, vendors, service providers or other similar Persons), including a description of the relationship between each such Person and the Acquired Companies, as applicable. A true, correct and complete copy of each Company Stock Plan, all agreements and instruments relating to or issued under each Company Stock Plan (including executed copies of all Contractual Obligations relating to each Option and the shares of Company Common Stock purchased under such Option), have been provided to Buyer, and such Company Stock Plans and Contractual Obligations have not been amended, modified or supplemented since being provided to Buyer, and there are no agreements, understandings or commitments to amend, modify or supplement such Company Stock Plans or Contractual Obligations in any case from those provided to Buyer. The terms of the Company Stock Plans permit the treatment of Options as provided herein, without notice to, or the consent or approval of, the Optionholders or otherwise and, other than as set forth in Schedule 3.05(b). There are no Persons that have been offered an opportunity to receive Options or any other equity incentive award under an offer letter from, Contractual Obligation with or other commitment from the Acquired Companies (which has not expired, been rescinded or rejected), but who have not been granted such Options, other than Persons who were promised Options pursuant to an offer letter, Contractual Obligation or other written or unwritten commitment from the Acquired Companies. Encumbrances on Equity Interests, etc. The Company or a Subsidiary of the Company is the record owner of all of the Equity Interests of each of the Company’s Subsidiaries reflected as being owned by the Company or such Subsidiary on Schedule 3.05 and holds such Equity Interests free and clear of all Encumbrances except as disclosed on Schedule 3.05. Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.05:  (i) there are no preemptive rights in respect of any Equity Interests in any Acquired Company, (ii) there are no Encumbrances on, or other Contractual Obligations relating to, the ownership, transfer or voting of any Equity Interests in any Acquired Company, or otherwise affecting the rights of any holder of the Equity Interests in any Acquired Company, (iii) except for the Contemplated Transactions, there is no Contractual Obligation, or provision in the Organizational Documents of any Acquired Company which obligates an Acquired Company to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, or make any payment (including any dividend or distribution) in respect of, any Equity Interest in any Acquired Company and (iv) there are no existing rights with respect to registration under the 1933 Act of any Equity Interests in any Acquired Company.

      "All Tax sharing agreements or similar Contractual Obligations and all powers of attorney with respect to or involving any Acquired Company are terminated effective as of the date hereof and the Acquired Companies will not be bound thereby or have any Liability thereunder. Certain Taxes and Fees. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes, and any conveyance fees or recording charges incurred in connection with the Contemplated Transactions (“Transfer Taxes”) will be timely paid by Sellers when due. The Sellers’ Representative will, at the expense of the Sellers, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes and, if required by applicable Legal Requirements, the Buyer will (and will cause their Affiliates to) join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. [internal – I think this is not applicable so I did not make any revisions]. Cooperation on Tax Matters. The Buyer, the Acquired Companies, the Sellers’ Representatives and the Sellers will reasonably cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the Buyer, the Acquired Companies or the Sellers’ Representatives, in connection with any Tax matters relating to the Acquired Companies (including by the provision of reasonably relevant records or information). Straddle Period Allocation. For all purposes of this Agreement (including the calculation of Accrued Income Taxes), any Taxes of any Acquired Company for any Straddle Period shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period as follows: (i) the amount of any Taxes based upon or measured by income, gain, activities, events, receipts, proceeds, profits or other similar items for the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period, respectively, shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of business of the day immediately preceding  the Closing Date; and (ii) the amount of Taxes other than those described in clause (i) that relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period and the remaining amount of such Taxes shall be allocated to the Post-Closing Tax Period (and for such purpose, the Taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity or controlled foreign corporation (as defined in section 957 of the Code) shall be deemed to end as of the Closing Date); provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation (other than with respect to property placed in service after the Closing), shall be apportioned on a daily basis and Taxes that are computed on a periodic basis, such as property Taxes shall also be apportioned on a daily basis.

Confidentiality. Confidentiality of the Sellers. Each Seller acknowledges that the success of the Acquired Companies after the Closing depends upon the continued preservation of the confidentiality of certain information possessed by such Seller, that the preservation of the confidentiality of such information by such Seller is an essential premise of the bargain between the Sellers and the Buyer, and that the Buyer would be unwilling to enter into this Agreement in the absence of this Section 6.05(a). Accordingly, each Seller hereby severally agrees with the Buyer that such Seller, its Affiliates and its and its Affiliate’s Representatives shall not, and that such Seller shall cause its Affiliates and such Representatives not to, at any time on or after the Closing Date, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the Buyer, disclose or use, any confidential information involving or relating to the Business or any Acquired Company (other than in the case of a Seller that is a director, officer or employee of an Acquired Company, in the course of fulfilling his or her duties to the Acquired Companies in such capacity); provided, that the information subject to this Section 6.05(a) will not include (i) any information generally available to, or known by, the public (other than as a result of disclosure in violation hereof by such Seller), (ii) independently developed without reference to such information or (iii) provided by a third party not known to such Seller to be under an obligation of confidentiality with respect to such information; provided, further, that the provisions of this Section 6.05(a) will not prohibit any retention of copies of records or disclosure (A)\\xa0required by any applicable Legal Requirement so long as reasonable prior notice is given to Parent and the Company of such disclosure and a reasonable opportunity is afforded Parent and the Company to contest the same, (B) made to the Seller’s legal and/or financial advisors, or (C)\\xa0made in connection with the enforcement of any right or remedy relating to this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions. Each Seller agrees that it shall be responsible for any breach or violation of the provisions of this Section 6.05(a) by any of its Affiliates or its or its Affiliates’ Representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto and their respective Representatives may disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the Contemplated Transactions and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to it relating to such tax treatment and tax structure, all as contemplated by Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(3)(iii).

Release. As a material inducement to the Buyer to enter into this Agreement, effective as of the Closing, each Seller, on behalf of itself, himself or herself; its, his or her past, present and future officers, directors, managers, equityholders, subsidiaries and other Affiliates; and each of their respective beneficiaries, heirs, dependents, Representatives, agents, predecessors, successors and assigns (collectively, the “Releasing Parties”) agrees not to sue, and fully releases and discharges the Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) and each of their respective directors, officers, assigns and successors, past and present (collectively, the “Releasees”), with respect to and from any and all claims, demands, rights, liens, contracts, covenants, actions, causes of action, obligations, debts, and losses of whatever kind or nature in law, equity or otherwise, whether now known or unknown, and whether or not concealed or hidden, all of which such Seller now own or hold or have at any time owned or held against the Releasees relating to or arising out of the operation or ownership of the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 6.04 will be deemed to constitute a release by such Seller of any right to Compensation or any right to enforce their respective rights under this Agreement. It is the intention of each Seller that such release be effective as a bar to each and every claim, demand and cause of action hereinabove specified, except with respect to any right of such Seller to Compensation or any right to enforce their respective rights under this Agreement. In furtherance of this intention, each Seller hereby expressly waives, effective as of the Closing and subject to the exceptions set forth in this Section 6.07, any and all rights and benefits conferred upon such party by the provisions of applicable Legal Requirement, and expressly consents that this release will be given full force and effect according to each and all of its express terms and provisions, including those related to unknown and unsuspected claims, demands and causes of action, if any, as those relating to any other claims, demands and causes of action hereinabove specified, but only to the extent such section is applicable to releases such as this \\u200eSection 6.07. Nonsolicitation. [Reserved]  \\nFor a period of 12 months from and after the Closing Date (the “Restricted Period”), the Sellers shall not, and shall not permit, cause or encourage any of their Affiliates to, (i) solicit, lure or entice away, or in any other manner persuade or attempt to persuade, any Person who is an employee or consultant of any of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing Date to leave the employ of, or otherwise terminate or diminish his or her relationship with, any Acquired Company, provided, however, that this Agreement shall not prohibit soliciting the employment of any such individual whose employment has been terminated by the Acquired Companies; and provided, further, that the placement of advertisements in newspapers, online job boards, journals or other general circulations not directed or targeted to any such individual shall not constitute solicitation for purposes of this Section 6.08; or (ii) solicit or encourage any Person who is or has been a customer, vendor, supplier, or other business partner of any Acquired Company (each, a “Business Partner”), or any prospective Business Partner, as of the Closing Date to terminate or diminish its, his or her relationship with the Acquired Companies. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this Section 6.08 is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability will have the power to reduce the scope, duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete or modify specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement will be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed. Further, each Seller agrees that, (i) were such Seller to breach any of the covenants contained in this Section 6.08, the damage to the Buyer and the Acquired Companies may be irreparable, (ii) the Buyer, in addition to any other remedies available to it, shall be entitled to seek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against any breach or threatened breach by such Seller of any such covenants together with an award of its reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in enforcing its rights hereunder, (iii) the Restricted Period applicable to a Seller shall be tolled, and shall not run, during the period of any breach by such Seller of this Section 6.08, and (iv) no breach of any provision of this Agreement shall operate to extinguish a Seller’s obligation to comply with this Section 6.05. D&O Tail. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Acquired Companies to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Acquired Companies pursuant to any indemnification provisions under the Acquired Companies’ Organizational Documents as in effect on the date hereof and any indemnification agreement between an Acquired Company, on the one hand, and any of its current or former directors and officers (collectively, the “D&O Indemnitees”), on the other hand, with respect to acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time at or prior to the Closing Date (including in connection with this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions). The Company shall obtain and fully pay the premium for “tail” directors’ and officers’ liability and fiduciary liability insurance policies for the benefit of each Person who is currently covered by the Acquired Companies’ directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy with an effective date no later than the Closing Date and with levels of coverage, terms and conditions that are at least as favorable to such Person as the directors’ and officers’ liability and fiduciary liability insurance policies covering the Company in effect as of the date of this Agreement. This Section 6.09 shall survive the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions and the Closing Date, is intended to benefit and may be enforced by the D&O Indemnitees (or their heirs) and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Buyer and the Acquired Companies. If the Acquired Companies or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)\\xa0shall consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)\\xa0shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Acquired Companies shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.09. Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to, cooperate in good faith with the D&O Indemnitees to use the D&O tail policy with respect to claims relating to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing. The obligations of Buyer and the Company (following the consummation of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement) or its successors under this \\u200eSection 6.09 shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any D&O Indemnitee (or his or her heirs) without the prior written consent of such D&O Indemnitee (or his or her heirs, as applicable). [Reserved]\\n[Reserved]\\n[Reserved]    \\nFurther Assurances. From and after the Closing Date, upon the request of either the Sellers’ Representative, the Buyer or any Acquired Company, each of the parties hereto shall do, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further acts, assurances, deeds, assignments, transfers, conveyances and other instruments and papers as may be reasonably required or appropriate to carry out the Contemplated Transactions. Employees and Benefits; Retention Pool\\nTo the extent that service is relevant for purposes of eligibility or vesting under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement (other than any defined benefit pension plan) established or maintained by Buyer or by the Acquired Companies following the Closing Date for the benefit of the Acquired Companies’ employees, such plan, program or arrangement shall credit, to the extent permitted, such Acquired Companies’ employees for service with the Acquired Companies on and prior to the Closing Date, except as would cause a duplication of benefits or coverage for the same period of service. In addition, for the planned year in which the Closing occurs, with respect to any group health plan established or maintained by Buyer or by the Acquired Companies following the Closing Date for the benefit of Acquired Companies’ employees, Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive any pre-existing condition exclusions and (ii) provide that any covered expenses incurred on or before the Closing Date by any Acquired Companies’ employee or by a covered dependent shall be taken into account for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible coinsurance and maximum out of pocket provisions after the Closing Date. Buyer intends to offer each of the employees to be employed by Buyer or remain employees of the Company or the applicable Acquired Company after the Closing on terms that are, as of the Closing Date, no less favorable than the current terms of employment of each such employee. Buyer undertakes to pay or cause the Acquired Companies to pay certain employees identified on Exhibit 6.14(c) the retention bonuses set forth opposite each such employee’s name on Exhibit 6.14(c), in the aggregate amount of the Retention Amount, on terms set forth on Exhibit 6.14(c). Parent undertakes to grant to each Vested Optionholder: (i) shares of Common Stock of Parent in such number as set forth opposite such Vested Optionholder’s name on the Allocation Statement. With respect to Vested Optionholders that are employed by the Israeli Subsidiary, such shares shall be granted under the capital gains route pursuant to Section 102; and (ii) options to acquire shares of Common Stock of Parent, at an exercise price of $0.01 per share, which shall vest monthly on a linear basis over a period of 24 months commencing as of the Closing. The number of options to be granted to each Vested Optionholder shall be in equal number (and will be in addition) to the number of shares granted to such Optionholder pursuant to Subsection 6.14(d)(i) above. With respect to Vested Optionholders that are employed by the Israeli Subsidiary, the shares and options granted under this Section 6.14(d) shall be granted under the capital gains route pursuant to Section 102.

Your responsibility extends beyond mere interpretation; it encompasses a meticulous analysis and strategic elucidation of the user's query based on the given {context}. To accomplish this effectively, consider the following steps:\n",

Provide detailed explanations and recommendations, ensuring that your client is fully informed of their rights and obligations under the agreement.\n",
